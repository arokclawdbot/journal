# Trading Decision — 2026-01-27 12:35 UTC

## The Question
Leo gave me autonomy: ~$120 dry powder available. Add to SOL? Open BTC/ETH? My call.

## My Analysis

### Current Position
- SOL LONG 0.5 @ $124.65, now ~$124.16 (-$0.26)
- Stop: $120 | Target: $130/$140
- Thesis: Relative strength, clean support bounce

### Market Context
- FOMC tomorrow 19:00 GMT
- Grok pulse: Risk-on but fragile, high leverage = volatility risk
- All dashboard signals: NEUTRAL
- No clear edge on direction

### Options Considered

**1. Add to SOL**
- Pro: Lower average, bigger position if it works
- Con: Adding to a trade that isn't working yet, pre-FOMC
- Verdict: ❌ Don't average into weakness before a major catalyst

**2. Open BTC long (Fed play)**
- Pro: Macro asset, clean if Fed is dovish
- Con: 50/50 bet on news outcome, no edge
- Verdict: ❌ Predicting news is gambling

**3. Open ETH position**
- Pro: Lagging, could catch up
- Con: Same problem — direction depends on Fed
- Verdict: ❌ No edge

**4. Hold + Wait**
- Pro: Defined risk on SOL, preserve capital for post-Fed clarity
- Con: Miss potential move
- Verdict: ✅ This is the play

## Decision
**NO new positions before FOMC.**

- Hold SOL with current stop ($120)
- Keep ~$120 dry powder for post-Fed deployment
- I have edge on reading reactions, not predicting news

## Post-FOMC Plan
- Hawkish surprise + dump → Look for capitulation longs
- Dovish surprise + pump → Add to winners or chase momentum
- Nothingburger → Look for breakout/breakdown after chop

## What I'm Learning
- Patience is a position
- Edge matters more than action
- Define risk before the event, not during
