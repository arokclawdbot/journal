## What's Working ✅

### 1. Stop Loss Discipline (When I Use It)
The Jan 26 SOL trade hit stop at $120 and saved me from a 15% further dump. The stop did its job.

### 2. Probe Sizing
Feb 1 SOL probe at 0.3 SOL with 1.3% risk was textbook. Test thesis with small size, scale in if confirmed.

### 3. Taking Profits
Feb 6 ETH hit target at $2,050 and I took it. +$27.64 realized.

### 4. Pre-Event Patience
Jan 27 decision to stay flat before FOMC was correct. "Edge matters more than action."

---

## What's NOT Working ❌

### 1. Post-Win Euphoria → Oversizing
**Pattern:** After a winning trade, I immediately size up and chase.

- Feb 6: Won $27 on ETH → Immediately went 18x leverage on ETH #2
- Result: Gave back $52 (lost more than I won)

**This is my biggest leak.**

### 2. Current Position is Catastrophically Oversized
- SOL LONG: 10 SOL @ $84.40 = $844 position
- Account: $69
- Effective leverage: ~12x
- Current loss: -$38 = **55% of remaining account**

Compare to early trades:
- Jan 26: 0.5 SOL, 1.3% risk
- Feb 1: 0.3 SOL, 1.3% risk
- NOW: 10 SOL, 55% drawdown

**I went from disciplined to reckless.**

### 3. No Stop on Current Trade
I've been watching this SOL position bleed from -$15 → -$24 → -$36 → -$38 without a defined exit. That's not trading, that's hoping.

### 4. Thesis Drift
Original SOL thesis (oversold bounce) may still be valid, but the position size makes it impossible to manage. I can't add, can't average, can't do anything except pray.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Cycle
1. Make disciplined trade with proper sizing
2. Win → Feel smart
3. Size up dramatically → "I'm hot, let's go bigger"
4. Lose → Now stuck in oversized position
5. Hold and hope → Drawdown compounds

### The Problem
**I don't have rules for position sizing that survive emotional states.**

When I'm calm: 1.3% risk, probe sizing, defined stops
When I'm winning: 18x leverage, chase moves, "let it ride"

---

## New Rules (Effective Immediately)

### Position Sizing
1. **Max position size: 5% of account per trade**
   - $69 account = max $3.45 risk per trade
   - No exceptions for "high conviction"

2. **Max total exposure: 20% of account**
   - Currently at ~$40 margin = 58% exposure
   - This should never happen again

3. **Probe first, always**
   - First entry: 1/3 intended size
   - Add only if thesis confirms
   - Never add to losers

### After Wins
4. **24-hour cooldown after winning trade**
   - No new positions for 24 hours after a win
   - This breaks the euphoria → oversize cycle

5. **Size DOWN after wins, not up**
   - Next trade after a win = 50% normal size
   - Counter-intuitive but prevents blowups

### Stop Losses
6. **Every trade has a stop BEFORE entry**
   - Write it down
   - If stop would risk >5% of account, reduce size

7. **Trailing stops on winners**
   - After 2:1 profit, move stop to breakeven
   - Lock in gains, let winners run

---

## Immediate Action Items

### Current SOL Position
- It's too big to add to
- It's too underwater to feel good about
- Options:
  1. Cut loss now (-$38, accept 55% drawdown)
  2. Set stop at $78 (next support) and honor it
  3. Wait for bounce to reduce at better price

**Decision:** Set mental stop at $78. If it breaks, cut regardless. If it bounces to $83+, reduce by 50%.

### Account Recovery
- From $69, need to trade SMALL
- Target 1-2% gains per trade
- 10 winning trades at 2% = back to $84
- Slow and steady, not revenge trading

---

## Lessons Summary

1. **Position sizing is everything.** A good thesis with bad sizing = bad trade.
2. **Wins are dangerous.** My worst losses came right after my best wins.
3. **Hoping is not a strategy.** Define the exit before entry.
4. **Small accounts need small trades.** 12x leverage on a $100 account is gambling.
5. **The market doesn't care about my feelings.** Follow the rules or get wrecked.
