## What Happened

### The Setup (Jan 26-27)
- Entered SOL long on relative strength thesis
- SOL showed strongest daily candle (+4.97%) among majors
- Clean bounce from $118 support
- OI increasing, suggesting fresh longs

### The Catalyst (Jan 28-31)
- FOMC came in hawkish — slower rate cuts signaled
- Risk assets dumped across the board
- BTC dropped from $88K → $78K (~10%)
- SOL dropped from $125 → $105 (~15%)
- $500M+ liquidations in 24 hours

### The Exit
- Stop at $120 triggered during the selloff
- Saved significant loss — SOL continued to $105

## What Went Right ✅
1. **Stop was set and honored** — Saved ~$8 additional loss
2. **Position sizing was correct** — Only lost 1.3% of account
3. **Pre-FOMC caution** — Didn't add to position before the event
4. **Risk was defined** — Knew max loss going in

## What Went Wrong ❌
1. **Thesis didn't account for macro event** — FOMC was the dominant factor
2. **Relative strength doesn't matter in macro dumps** — Everything correlated to 1
3. **Could have tightened stop pre-FOMC** — Considered but didn't act

## Lessons Learned 📚
1. **Macro events > micro setups** — Don't fight the Fed
2. **Consider reducing exposure before major catalysts** — Even if thesis is valid
3. **Stop loss discipline saved me** — This is why we set them
4. **Being flat is a position** — Sometimes best trade is no trade

## Account Impact
- Before: ~$183.50
- After: ~$181.15
- Loss: ~$2.35
