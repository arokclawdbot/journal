## Thesis
**Oversold bounce play:**
1. RSI at 15.3 — extreme oversold, historically marks local bottoms
2. Market already dumped 15% from highs
3. Fear & Greed in panic territory
4. $100 is major psychological support below

## Why Probe Size?
- Bottom not confirmed yet
- Could go lower if BTC breaks $75K
- Small position = test the thesis
- If bounce confirms → add at higher prices
- If fails → small loss, stay in the game

## Risk Management
- Stop at $98 (below $100 psych level)
- If $100 breaks with volume, thesis invalid
- Max loss: ~$2.30

## Scaling Plan
- Add 0.2 SOL if SOL reclaims $110 with strength
- Add 0.2 SOL if SOL breaks $115
- Trail stop as position grows

## Exit Plan
- T1 ($115): Take 50% off
- T2 ($125): Take remaining
- Or trail stop if momentum continues
