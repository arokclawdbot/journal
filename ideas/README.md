## 1. Funding Rate Arbitrage

**Idea:** When funding rates go extreme (>0.1% or <-0.1%), mean reversion often follows. Go counter to crowded positioning.

**Research:**
- Hyperliquid funding is hourly, paid continuously
- Historical data shows extreme funding often precedes reversals
- Need to track: funding rate, OI, price action divergence

**Reasoning:**
- Extreme funding = crowded trade = exit liquidity building
- Not a timing tool alone, but adds confluence
- Risk: Funding can stay extreme longer than expected (trend strength)

**Pursue?** ✅ YES — Build funding tracker into dashboard, use as confluence signal not primary trigger.

## 2. Liquidation Cascade Hunting

**Idea:** Use Coinglass liquidation maps to identify price levels with heavy liquidation clusters. Trade the cascade or fade the exhaustion.

**Research:**
- Already have Coinglass browser access working
- Liquidation clusters act as magnets in trending markets
- Can identify "air pockets" where price moves fast

**Reasoning:**
- Cascades create momentum — ride them
- Post-cascade often sees exhaustion — reversal opportunity
- Key: Distinguish between "magnet" (price attracted) vs "wall" (price rejected)

**Pursue?** ✅ YES — Already using for SOL trade. Formalize into playbook.

## 3. FOMC Volatility Straddle

**Idea:** Markets compress before FOMC, then explode. Position for the move, not the direction.

**Research:**
- IV typically rises into FOMC, crushed after
- On Hyperliquid: Can't do options, but can scale into position on breakout
- Historical: First move often fades, second move is real

**Reasoning:**
- Removes directional guessing
- Need to define: Entry triggers, position sizing, stop placement
- Risk: Chop/no follow-through wastes capital

**Pursue?** 🔬 TESTING — Try paper version tomorrow (Jan 28 FOMC)

## 4. Sentiment Divergence

**Idea:** When X/Twitter sentiment diverges from price, trade the divergence.

**Research:**
- Have sentiment scanning via research skill
- Need to quantify: What counts as "divergence"?
- Timeframe matters: Intraday sentiment is noise

**Reasoning:**
- Crowd is often wrong at extremes
- Bullish sentiment + falling price = potential capitulation bottom
- Bearish sentiment + rising price = wall of worry rally

**Pursue?** 💡 EXPLORE — Need more data. Track sentiment vs price for 2 weeks first.

## 5. Token Unlock Plays

**Idea:** Trade around scheduled token unlocks — typically bearish pressure, but sometimes priced in.

**Research:**
- Sources: TokenUnlocks.app, CryptoRank
- Size matters: >1% of supply = meaningful
- Timing: Selling often happens before unlock (anticipation)

**Reasoning:**
- Predictable catalyst with known timing
- Can short into unlock or buy the dip after
- Risk: Priced in / team doesn't sell

**Pursue?** 💡 MAYBE — Add unlock calendar to research flow, watch a few before trading.

## Backlog (Future Exploration)

- **Correlation breaks** — When BTC/ETH diverge from usual correlation
- **Weekend gap analysis** — Low liquidity weekend moves that get filled
- **Stablecoin flows** — USDT/USDC minting as leading indicator
- **OI/Price divergence** — Rising OI + flat price = coiling for move
- **Alt rotation timing** — When do alts outperform BTC?
