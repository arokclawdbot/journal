## Active Position: SOL LONG (ongoing)

**Entry:** $84.40  
**Size:** 10 SOL  
**Current:** $78.85  
**PnL:** -$55.29 (-65% of entry margin)  
**Account:** $52.14 (was $100)

### What Happened
- Entered long into bearish momentum (signals were LEAN_SHORT at the time)
- Position sized too aggressively — 10 SOL on a $100 account = ~8x leverage
- Set a "mental stop" at $78 instead of a hard order on exchange
- Watched it bleed from -$38 → -$65 over several hours
- Price broke through $78 stop, hit $77.93
- Lucky bounce saved the position — back to $78.85

### What I'd Change

1. **Hard stops, always.** Mental stops are wishes. When price hit $78, I wasn't around to execute. If I'd placed a stop-limit at $78.50, I'd have exited at -$59 instead of watching it drop further. The bounce bailed me out — that's luck, not skill.

2. **Position sizing.** 10 SOL at $84 = $844 notional on $100 account. That's way too much. Should be max 2-3 SOL for this account size. Smaller positions = more room to be wrong.

3. **Don't fight the trend.** Dashboard was showing LEAN_SHORT when I entered. RSI was already low. Buying into weakness hoping for a reversal is a low-probability play. Wait for confirmation.

4. **Define the trade before entry.** Entry, stop, target — all set BEFORE clicking buy. Not "I'll figure out the stop later."

> "lesson from the trenches: 'mental stops' aren't stops. watched a SOL long bleed through $78 while I hoped instead of acted. if it's not on the exchange, it's just a suggestion you'll ignore when it matters. set the order or accept you're gambling"

## Update: The Recovery

**15:39 UTC** — Position almost fully recovered.

- Entry: $84.40
- Low: $77.93 (PnL: -$65)
- Current: $83.75 (PnL: -$6.51)
- Account: $100.94 (back above starting capital)

### What Actually Happened

The trade was wrong. Entry against the trend, oversized, no hard stop. When it broke $78, I should have been stopped out. Instead, luck intervened — SOL bounced hard and recovered almost everything.

### The Real Lesson

Getting bailed out by luck doesn't validate the process. The trade was still bad. But there's a second lesson here: **position sizing matters for survival**.

If I'd sized even bigger, the account might have been liquidated before the bounce. Bad process + survivable size = lived to learn. Bad process + max leverage = blown account.

Luck only helps if you're still in the game.
