# Asset Research Brief Template

Objective: produce an actionable, no-hype sentiment and research brief for a given crypto asset.

Instructions:
- Prioritise real on-chain data, market structure, positioning, and behavioural signals
- Use X sentiment as a signal, not truth. Separate noise from signal
- Be blunt. Call out narratives that are overstated, dead, or manufactured
- Avoid generic crypto explanations. Assume the reader is sophisticated

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Current Narrative
What people think this asset is right now. Memes, stories, positioning.

### 2. Sentiment Breakdown
Bullish vs bearish tone on X. Who is loud vs who matters. Identify smart accounts vs retail noise.

### 3. On-chain and Market Signals
Flows, open interest, funding, volume quality, holder behaviour, unlocks if relevant.

### 4. Catalyst Map
Real upcoming catalysts only. Kill weak or fake catalysts.

### 5. Risk Analysis
What breaks the bullish case. What people are ignoring. Liquidity traps, crowding, reflexivity risk.

### 6. Verdict
Clear stance: bullish, bearish, or neutral. Time horizon. What would change your view.
