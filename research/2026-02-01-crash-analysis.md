- Next major supports: BTC $75K, SOL $100

### Sentiment
- Fear & Greed: Dropped from "Extreme Greed" to "Neutral/Fear"

- Smart money: Some accumulation signals at lows

## Outlook

### Bear Case

## Trading Implications

### Re-entry Considerations
- Wait for stabilization (higher lows)
- Scale in, don't full send

- Watch $100 SOL and $75K BTC as lines in sand

### Risk Management
- Smaller position sizes
- Wider stops (volatility expanded)
- Don't catch falling knives
- Be patient
