**Key Takeaways:**
- **High-Impact Events Dominate:** Federal Reserve decision, US PCE data, SEC hearing, and Bitcoin ETF deadline are critical, with potential to drive significant market moves in the next 48 hours.
- **Risk-off Bias Prevails:** Most macro events (Fed, inflation, SEC) lean toward bearish pressure on crypto unless outcomes are surprisingly positive.
- **Crypto-Specific Catalysts:** Ethereum Dencun upgrade and Bitcoin ETF decision offer potential upside if outcomes are favorable, but carry downside risk on failure.
- **Volatility Expected:** With multiple high-impact events rated 8-9/10, expect sharp price swings; risk management is crucial for traders.
