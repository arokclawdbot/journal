**Key Takeaways:**
- **High-Impact Events:** US PCE data and SEC hearing are the most critical within the 48-hour window. PCE could set the tone for Fed policy expectations, while SEC outcomes may directly affect crypto sentiment.
- **Volatility Risk:** SEC hearing (9/10) and PCE data (8/10) carry the highest potential for sharp price swings. Prepare for sudden moves, especially on negative regulatory news.
- **Overall Bias:** Predominantly risk-off due to inflation data, regulatory scrutiny, and token unlock pressures. Positive tech earnings could provide a minor counterbalance.
- **Focus:** Monitor PCE for broader market risk sentiment and SEC hearing for direct crypto impact. Position sizing and stop-losses are advised given elevated volatility potential.
