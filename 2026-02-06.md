Thesis played out perfectly. ETH caught up to BTC/SOL momentum post-CPI/Powell. Trailed stop to lock profit, let winner run to target.

## Trades Closed: Cut Losses (18:09 UTC)

**Reason:** Signals flipped STRONG_SHORT across all majors. MACD turning bearish. Cut before stops hit.

| Trade | Entry | Exit | Result |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| ETH #2 Long | $2,064.89 | $2,034.10 | -$52.82 |
| TAO Long | $177.16 | $173.85 | -$1.66 |
| PAXG Short | $4,959.50 | $4,961.20 | -$0.03 |

**Lesson:** Sized up (18x leverage) right after rally topped. Signals were overbought but bullish when we entered. They flipped within minutes. Should wait for pullback entries, not chase extended moves.

**Account:** $173.50 → $144.12 (-17% on day)
